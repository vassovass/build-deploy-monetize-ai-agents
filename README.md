# Build, deploy, and monetize AI agents

Build a real AI agent, ship it to the Apify platform, and turn it into something people (and
other agents) can pay to use - all from this one forked repo.

## How it works

In about 40 minutes you will build an AI agent and take it through the full Apify Actor
lifecycle: build, deploy, and monetize.

This is a **live, build-along workshop**. We pick one example use case and build it together,
end to end, while explaining each step:

- We scaffold a starter, build an AI agent on top of it, then run, deploy, and monetize it live.
- You follow along in your own fork. This repo is your project root, so you scaffold and build
  your Actor right here, in place.
- Each step ends with a "now do this for your own project" nudge, so by the end you can swap the
  example for your own idea and take it straight into your hackathon.

The example is chosen on the day. It is just a vehicle for the lifecycle, so anything you build
follows the same shape.

An **[Actor](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors)** is a serverless program on
[the Apify platform](https://docs.apify.com/platform): it takes JSON input, does a task, and
writes results to a [dataset](https://docs.apify.com/platform/storage/dataset). That simple
shape is all you need to build, deploy, monetize, and eventually run a full AI agent.

## Scope

What we cover, in order. Each step builds on the last.

1. [Step 1: Setup and your first Actor](#step-1-setup-and-your-first-actor) (~10 min)
2. [Step 2: Build your agent](#step-2-build-your-agent) (~20 min)
3. [Step 3: Deploy](#step-3-deploy) (~10 min)

5. [Step 5: Use Apify in your hackathon project](#step-5-use-apify-in-your-hackathon-project) (~5 min)

## Prerequisites

- An **[Apify account](https://console.apify.com/sign-up?couponId=AABW2026&utm_source=aabw&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=events-2026-aabw)** and an **API token** (you create
  the [token](https://docs.apify.com/platform/integrations/api) in Apify Console). You can sign
  up for free and most of the workshop runs on the free tier.
- **[Node.js 22+](https://nodejs.org/)** - the [Apify CLI](https://docs.apify.com/cli/) runs on
  Node.
- **[Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)** - for your Actor and the AI agent in
  step 2.
- An **AI coding tool with Agent Skills support** - [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code),
  [Cursor](https://cursor.com/), or similar. You will install an Apify skill into it.
- An **LLM API key** for step 2 - Anthropic and/or OpenAI. Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and/or
  `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your environment.

> **Note:** The Apify free tier includes monthly usage credits, which is plenty for this
> workshop. This event also includes a coupon (`AABW2026`) for extra credits for your own
> project - redeem it under [**Settings > Billing**](https://console.apify.com/billing) in
> Apify Console early so the credits are ready when you need them (details in
> [step 5](#step-5-use-apify-in-your-hackathon-project)).

## Step 1: Setup and your first Actor

Install your tools and create, run, and inspect your first Actor locally - no Apify
account needed yet.

**Time:** ~10 minutes

### 1. Install Node.js and Python

Make sure you have the runtimes the workshop needs:

```bash
node --version    # should be 22 or higher
python --version  # should be 3.10 or higher
```

If either is missing or too old, install it before continuing.

### 2. Install the Apify CLI

The [Apify CLI](https://docs.apify.com/cli/) is how you create, run, and deploy Actors from
your terminal. See the [installation guide](https://docs.apify.com/cli/docs/installation) for
other install methods.

```bash
npm install -g apify-cli
apify --version
```

You should see a version number printed.

### 3. Set your LLM API key

You will need this in step 2, so set it now. Add one or both to your shell environment:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

If you plan to run either bundled template (`python-langgraph` or `js-langgraph-agent`) locally,
also store the key in the Apify CLI's secret store now - both templates' `.actor/actor.json`
reference the `@OPENAI_API_KEY` secret, and `apify run` fails when it is missing, even with the
key exported:

```bash
apify secrets add OPENAI_API_KEY "sk-..."
```

> **Tip:** Add the exports to your shell profile (for example `~/.zshrc`) so they persist across
> sessions. Never commit keys to the repo.

### 4. Install the Apify Actor Development skill

This skill teaches your AI coding tool how to scaffold, build, and deploy Actors. It powers the
vibe-coding in step 2.

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/apify/agent-skills --skill apify-actor-development
```

Pick the `apify-actor-development` skill when prompted. You can browse all available skills in
the [apify/agent-skills](https://github.com/apify/agent-skills) repo, and read what this one
does in its [SKILL.md](https://github.com/apify/agent-skills/blob/main/skills/apify-actor-development/SKILL.md).

### 5. Create your first Actor

From the root of this repo, scaffold a basic Actor:

```bash
apify create
```

When prompted, choose **Python** or **JavaScript**  and the **LangGraph AI agent** template. The CLI
creates your Actor's files in place. Browse every starter at
[Apify Actor templates](https://apify.com/templates), and read the
[Python SDK docs](https://docs.apify.com/sdk/python) or [JavaScript SDK docs](https://docs.apify.com/sdk/js) for how Actor code is structured.

### 6. Tour the structure

Open the files the CLI created and find these (all defined in the
[Actor definition](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development/actor-definition) docs):

- [`.actor/actor.json`](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development/actor-definition/actor-json) -
  your Actor's metadata and configuration.
- [`.actor/input_schema.json`](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development/actor-definition/input-schema) -
  the shape of the JSON input your Actor accepts.
- `src/` - your Actor's code (the `main` entry point lives here). The bundled
  `python-langgraph` template keeps its code in `my_actor/` instead.
- [`Dockerfile`](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development/actor-definition/dockerfile) -
  how your Actor is built and run on the Apify platform.

### 7. Run it locally

```bash
apify run
```

The Actor runs on your machine. When it finishes, look in the `storage/` folder: your output
is written to `storage/datasets/default/`, and any input it read is in
`storage/key_value_stores/default/`. See the
[Storage docs](https://docs.apify.com/platform/storage) for how datasets and key-value stores
work.

> **Note:** The Actor model is just this: JSON input goes in, the Actor runs a task, and
> results go out to a dataset. Everything else in this workshop builds on that shape.

**Resources**

- [Apify CLI installation](https://docs.apify.com/cli/docs/installation) and
  [command reference](https://docs.apify.com/cli/docs/reference)
- [Apify Actor templates](https://apify.com/templates)
- [Actor definition](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development/actor-definition):

- [apify/agent-skills](https://github.com/apify/agent-skills)

Continue to [Step 2: Build your agent](#step-2-build-your-agent).

---

## Step 2: Build your agent

This is the heart of the workshop. Turn your starter Actor into a real AI agent: a reasoning
loop that calls tools and writes its results to a dataset.

**Time:** ~20 minutes

### 1. Understand the pattern

An AI agent on Apify is just an Actor with three parts:

- **The agent loop runs inside the Actor.** The Actor's code drives an LLM that reasons, decides
  what to do next, and repeats until the task is done.
- **Apify Actors are the tools.** When the agent needs real data or an action, it calls another
  Actor from [Apify Store](https://apify.com/store) (a scraper, a search Actor, your own Actor)
  over the [API](https://docs.apify.com/api/v2).
- **The dataset is the output.** Whatever the agent produces gets written to the dataset, just
  like in step 1.

You can hand-wire the loop yourself with
**[LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/)** (`pip install langgraph`), or let a
framework run it for you with the
**[OpenAI Agents SDK](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/)**
(`pip install openai-agents`, `from agents import Agent, Runner`). Use whichever you prefer.
Either way, point it at the latest [Claude](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/about-claude/models)
or [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) model and check the provider docs for the
current model id.

> **Tip:** You don't have to wire each tool by hand. Point your agent at the
> [Apify MCP server](https://docs.apify.com/platform/integrations/mcp) (`https://mcp.apify.com`)
> and it can discover and call thousands of Apify Store Actors as
> [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) tools, with no per-tool glue code.

### 2. Pick your agent

Pick the example we build together in this workshop, or bring your own. Keep it small enough to
finish in this step: one clear input, one tool Actor, one useful output.

### 3. Vibe-code it with your AI tool

You installed the `apify-actor-development` skill in step 1, so let your AI coding tool build it
for you. Describe the agent and let it scaffold and implement the code in this repo. For
example:

```
Build an AI agent inside this Actor. It takes a {your input} as input, uses the
{an Apify Store Actor} Actor as a tool to fetch data, runs an agent loop with
{LangGraph or the OpenAI Agents SDK} on the latest Claude model, and writes the
{your result} to the dataset. Add the LLM API key as a secret input in the input
schema so it works both locally and once deployed. Follow the Apify Actor
Development skill.
```

Let the tool update your input schema, add dependencies, and write the loop. Review what it
generates.

### 4. Run it locally

```bash
apify run
```

Pass your input, watch the agent loop in the logs, and check the result in
`storage/datasets/default/`. This is the payoff - a working agent on your machine before you
deploy anything.

> **Tip:** If the agent calls another Actor as a tool, it needs an Apify API token at runtime.
> The quickest way is to run `apify login` now (covered in step 3) - `apify run` then injects
> your token automatically as `APIFY_TOKEN`, and the
> [Apify client for Python](https://docs.apify.com/api/client/python/) picks it up with no extra
> setup. Or export `APIFY_TOKEN` manually if you run the script outside `apify run`.

Continue to [Step 3: Deploy](#step-3-deploy).

---

## Step 3: Deploy

Your agent works locally. Now deploy it to the Apify platform so it runs in the cloud and can
be started by anyone, or any agent, over the API.

**Time:** ~10 minutes

### 1. Get your API token

In Apify Console, open **Settings > API & Integrations** and copy your personal API token. See
[API integration](https://docs.apify.com/platform/integrations/api) for details.

### 2. Log in from the CLI

```bash
apify login
```

Paste your API token when prompted. This links the CLI to your Apify account. It also lets your
local `apify run` reach Actors you use as tools, so if you skipped logging in during step 2,
this covers it.

### 3. Add your LLM key to the platform

The deployed Actor needs its own copy of the LLM key, stored as a secret and referenced from
your `.actor/actor.json`. The secret name has to match whatever that file references - both
bundled templates (`python-langgraph` and `js-langgraph-agent`) reference `@OPENAI_API_KEY`
(if you already added it in step 1.3, you are done):

```bash
apify secrets add OPENAI_API_KEY "sk-..."
```

If you swapped the agent to Claude, create `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` instead.

> **Note:** Secrets you add with `apify secrets` live on the Apify platform and are injected at
> runtime, encrypted at rest and redacted from logs. Without this, the deployed run fails at the
> first model call - the key in your shell never leaves your machine. See
> [secret environment variables](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development/programming-interface/environment-variables)
> and [secret inputs](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development/actor-definition/input-schema/secret-input).

### 4. Push your Actor

```bash
apify push
```

This builds your Actor on the Apify platform and uploads your code. When it finishes, the CLI
prints a link to your Actor in Apify Console.

### 5. Run it in Apify Console

Open the link, fill in the input, and click **Start**. When the run finishes, open the
**Dataset** tab to confirm your agent produces the same result it did locally, now on the Apify
platform. The [Running Actors](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/running) docs walk through
this in Apify Console.

### 6. Note the API endpoint

Every Actor has a run endpoint, so you (or another agent) can trigger it over HTTP from anywhere:

```
https://api.apify.com/v2/acts/<your-username>~<actor-name>/runs?token=<API_TOKEN>
```

This is how your agent gets called in production. See
[Run Actor and retrieve data via API](https://docs.apify.com/academy/api/run-actor-and-retrieve-data-via-api)
and the [Apify API reference](https://docs.apify.com/api/v2).

### 7. Or start it over MCP

Your Actor is also reachable through the Apify MCP server, so any MCP client - Claude, Cursor,
or another agent - can discover and run it as a tool. Point the client at
`https://mcp.apify.com` (OAuth on first use). Combined with pay per event, this is how an
autonomous agent finds and pays for your Actor. See
[Apify MCP server](https://docs.apify.com/platform/integrations/mcp).

Continue to [Step 4: Monetize and publish](#step-4-monetize-and-publish).

---

## Step 4: Monetize and publish

Your agent runs on the platform. Now publish it to Apify Store and put a price on it, so other
people, and other agents, can discover, run, and pay for it.

**Time:** ~10 minutes

### 1. Add your billing details

Before you can monetize, add your billing and payout details in Apify Console under
**Settings > Billing**. This is a prerequisite for receiving payouts.

### 2. Publish to Apify Store

Open your Actor in Apify Console, go to the **Publication** tab, complete the publish checklist,
and submit it to Apify Store. A public Actor is what other people (and agents) can discover and
run. See [Publish your Actor](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/publishing/publish) for the
full checklist.

### 3. Choose a pricing model

The Apify platform supports a few pricing models. For an AI agent, focus on:

- **Pay per usage** - users pay only for the platform resources their run consumes.
- **Pay per event (PPE)** - users pay for specific events you define, such as each result
  produced. This is the most flexible model for agents.

### 4. Set up monetization

In the **Publication** tab, open **Monetization** and follow the wizard (full walkthrough in
[Monetize your Actor](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/publishing/monetize)):

1. **Actor pricing** - choose your pricing model and configure the events or rates.
2. **Primary event** - pick the one event that best represents the value your Actor delivers
   (for example, one result returned).
3. **Review** - confirm everything, then submit.

> **Note:** The bundled templates already declare their events in `.actor/pay_per_event.json`
> (`actor-start` and `task-completed`). Pick **Pay per event** in the wizard and configure those
> events - until you do, the `Actor.charge()` calls in the code are ignored and the Actor
> earns nothing.

> **Note:** Pay-per-event Actors with limited permissions automatically become eligible for
> autonomous agent payment over protocols like x402 and Skyfire. There is no separate opt-in,
> so an AI agent can discover and pay for your Actor on its own. Pay-per-usage Actors are not
> eligible.

### 5. Track your earnings

Once your Actor has paying users, find your earnings in Apify Console under **Insights**. Payout
invoices are generated automatically each month.

Continue to [Step 5: Use Apify in your hackathon project](#step-5-use-apify-in-your-hackathon-project).

---

## Step 5: Use Apify in your hackathon project

See how Apify speeds up your hackathon project - both as an AI agent you build from
this repo and as thousands of ready-made Actors you can plug straight in.

### Build your own AI agent from this repo

You now have the full lifecycle working. Fork this repo and use it as the starting point for your
own agent: the pattern stays fixed (loop, tools, dataset), and you change only three parts:
the input, the tool Actor it calls, and the output it writes. Let your AI coding tool plus the
`apify-actor-development` skill scaffold and write it, and keep the LLM API key as a secret input
so it works locally and once deployed. When it works, deploy and publish it just like in steps
2 to 4.

### Don't build from scratch - use ready-made Actors

You do not have to build everything yourself. [Apify Store](https://apify.com/store) has
thousands of ready-made Actors - scrapers, data extractors, integrations, and AI tools - that
you can use in your project in three ways:

- **As MCP tools, with zero glue code** - point your AI coding tool or agent at the
  [Apify MCP server](https://docs.apify.com/platform/integrations/mcp) (`https://mcp.apify.com`)
  and every Store Actor becomes a tool it can discover and call. The fastest way to give an agent
  real capabilities during a hackathon.
- **As tools your agent calls directly** - wire a Store Actor into your agent with the
  [Apify client for Python](https://docs.apify.com/api/client/python/), exactly like the workshop
  agent did.
- **As building blocks in any project** - call a Store Actor over the
  [API](https://docs.apify.com/api/v2) from any stack to get data or automation without writing
  the scraper or integration yourself. Even if your hackathon project is not an AI agent, this is
  the fastest way to get real data into it.

Browse [Apify Store](https://apify.com/store), find an Actor for your domain, and wire it in.
